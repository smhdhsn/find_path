# Find Path Project - Harvard's CS50x AI

This project is an implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms as part of the CS50x AI course at Harvard. It focuses on the foundational pathfinding techniques that drive search-based AI applications. Using both DFS and BFS, this project explores different ways of navigating a graph or grid to reach a goal state, illustrating how each algorithm handles decision trees, efficiency, and solution paths.

## Key Features

- **DFS**: A recursive, stack-based approach to explore nodes in-depth before backtracking.
- **BFS**: A queue-based algorithm for level-by-level exploration, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted scenarios.
- **Comparison and Analysis**: Highlights the strengths and limitations of each method in various scenarios.

Ideal for those studying pathfinding algorithms or seeking to understand the search foundations in AI.
