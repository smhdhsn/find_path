"""
This project is an implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) 
algorithms as part of the CS50x AI course at Harvard. It focuses on the foundational pathfinding 
techniques that drive search-based AI applications. Using both DFS and BFS, this project explores 
different ways of navigating a graph or grid to reach a goal state, illustrating how each algorithm 
handles decision trees, efficiency, and solution paths.
